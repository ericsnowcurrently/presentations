Adding Something New to the Python Language: Multiple Interpreters for Multi-Core Support

Here's your chance to see how the Python language evolves and even to
participate in the process.  I'll be discussing a proposal I made on
python-ideas@python.org[1] to improve Python's multi-core support.
There are still a lot of open questions and the solution is far from
settled.

First I'll explain the problem space and the feedback I've gotten thus
far.  Then we'll collaborate on possible solutions to open questions.
Throughout we'll take a look at how what we're doing fits into the
Python core development process.  The focus will be on collaborating
on a solution to a real problem that has a good chance of impacting
the Python language (in version 3.6).
